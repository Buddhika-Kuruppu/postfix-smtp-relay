# postfix-smtp-relay
A Postfix SMTP relay GitHub repo hosts code and configuration to run Postfix  — a popular open-source Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) — configured as an SMTP relay server. In this setup, Postfix accepts outgoing mail from clients or applications and forwards (relays) it to another SMTP server for actual delivery.
